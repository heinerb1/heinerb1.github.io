### Week 1: April 26, 2021

* **Monday**:    Moved to a new apartment.
* **Tuesday**:   Moved to a new apartment.
* **Wednesday**: Set up computer and website, completed linux tutorial, and attened immerse meetings.
* **Thursday**:  Set up and experimented with VTR, attended VTR meeting, upgraded Linux, and compared 
                 the FPGA implementation in VTR and Vivado.
* **Friday**:    Read about VTR Architecture xml files and created a custom architecture by copying an 
                 existing architecture and modifying it. Attended bootcamp meeting about github.

### Week 2: May 3, 2021

* **Monday**:   Created an XML Architecture Template that explains necessary commands and includes examples.
                Experimented with architecture layouts and attended bootcamp meeting about VSCode.
* **Tuesday**:  Read about what Netcracker revealed about Xilinx FPGA routing and studied Xilinx FPGA implemented 
                design. Created a new architecture from my template and experimented with different designs.
* **Wednesday**: Continued to study Xilinx architecture and compare it with VPR designs. Completed assignments for 
                 Ethics group. Attended immerse meetings.
* **Thursday**: In-depth study of Xilinix architecture. Attended meeting about VTR project. Worked on assignment for
                Ethics group.
* **Friday**: Continued in-depth study of Xilinix architecture and read about FPGA routing. Attended bootcamp 
              meeting about cmake.

### Week 3: May 10, 2021

* **Monday**:   Assembled a verilog program in VTR and studied the primitives in the symbiflow arch def project. 
                Attended bootcamp meeting about python and wrote several small python scripts to practice.
* **Tuesday**:  Adjusted my website and added myself to the CCL website. Fixed several small bugs in VTR architecture 
                files, improved one of my python scripts, and studied more about FPGA architecture.
* **Wednesday**: Created the csv_parser python script and attended immerse meetings. Also made another small adjustment
                 to my website and updated git repositories.
* **Thursday**: Read about Xilinx primitives and compared them to the symbiflow_arch_defs xml files. Attended meeting 
                about VTR, wrote a python script to convert tab delinieated .txt files to comma deliniated .csv files, and ran some regression tests.
* **Friday**: Ran regression tests to comapre modified versions of VTR architectures to their originals, attended bootcamp 
              meeting about python packages, and experimented with the packages.

### Week 4: May 17, 2021

* **Monday**: Ran additional regression tests on modified files and attended bootcamp about unit tests and github actions. Also 
              wrote summer proposal.
* **Tuesday**: Made modifications to a test architecture to make it mirror the Vivado architecture layout. Ran regression tests on
               various designs and also worked on a CVS finder python script.
* **Wednesday**: Added additional clock regions to the test architecture, attended immerse meetings, and experimented with pylint and 
                 sphinx. Also worked more on CVS script.
* **Thursday**: Worked more on the test architecture and examined switchblock connections in VTR. Attended VTR meeting and started  
                reading about how to use Netcracker.
* **Friday**: Started working on project presentation, attended bootcamp meeting about docker, and read more about how
              to use Netcracker.

### Week 5: May 24, 2021

* **Monday**: Completed project presentation, attended FPGA overview meeting, and compared different
              Artix-7 architectures. Also set up an xserver on my laptop so I can work remotely.
